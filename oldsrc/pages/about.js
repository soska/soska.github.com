          Hello! My full name is <em>Armando Quetzalcoatl Sosa Garay</em>, but
          my friends just call me <strong>Armando</strong>. All three of them.

          I'm a small mexican dude who has been doing internet stuff for what
          feels like an eternity. I used to be a graphic designer but, fun fact:
          that's the worst paid profession in Mexico, so I pivoted to
          programming and I've been doing a lot better.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not in front of a computer you may find me attending church,
          playing music, or just hanging out with my wonderful wife.
        </p>

          I am a type-2 diabetic, which sucks because eating is my favorite
          hobby. Look, it's not my fault that I live in the country with the
          best food in the <del>world</del> universe.
        </p>

          I've been working as a remote front-end engineer since 2009 for
          companies in New York, San Francisco, and Colombia. Currently I am
          eployed by <a href="https://paidlabs.com">Paid Labs</a> as a React
          Developer.
