Just a quick notice to announce that I released new versions of both [Keyboardist](https://github.com/soska/keyboardist) and [React Keyboardist](https://github.com/soska/keyboardist) that adds support for listening to keyboard events on `input` and `textarea` elements.

I think this will be very useful for things like live search components or WYSIWYG editors.
