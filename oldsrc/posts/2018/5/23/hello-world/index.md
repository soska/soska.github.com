The idea of writting again is terrifying.

Yes, I used to write regularly in bloig-form for almost 6 years starting in 2004 and then I stopped. I've been wanting for a while to write again and use that writing to re-launch my online presence but I can't get myself to do it.

The most terrifying part is that I need to write in English this time, instead of my native Spanish and and I don't feel very confident doing that. Don't get me wrong: I'm already a lousy writter in my native language, but at least I have several decades of practice. Even then, it was the lack of relevancy of writting in Spanish was one of the things that made me stop almost a decade ago. I love my language but English is the norm in the tech space.

Another reason I stopped blogging is that I was sick of WordPress. It is true that developing WP themes and plugins put food on my table for many years but, ugh, it's like when you work on a pizzeria for a while and hate pizza thereafter. Maybe I'll reacquire a taste for dynamic PHP CMS but in the mean time this blog is [powered by Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com).

Finally, it was the rise of social media (Twitter, Facebook) that made me think that I didn't need a blog after all. Now social media is broken and toxic and I realized that a blog is still an options so here I am.

And now, maybe you're figuring out that this nonsensical post is basically a glorified lorem ipsum. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll write a real blog post next time.

Thank you for reading.
